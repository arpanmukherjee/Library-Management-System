Console based Library Management System(LMS)-an Online Catalog as a part of Library Management
System (LMS). We have to design the system where Visitors to the library can search library
catalog online to get details of various resources - books, periodicals and ebooks. Each
resource may have multiple copies. Each copy of a resource has a unique ID along with other
detailsâ€‹ - Title, author name, category(Operating Systems, Algorithms etc). Further, each book
and ebook may store edition details(Number, release year) and each periodical should store
period detail.
The library manager may reserve or release an item in the records, on the respective event of
issuing or return of a resource.
This project has been completed under the course OOPD for 1st semester.
